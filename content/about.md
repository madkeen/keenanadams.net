I'm a user experience designer and developer with a keen interest in designing technology for social good. I'm happiest most when get to be involved across the areas of user research, analysis and design.

I have a background in front-end dev having worked on many projects including freelancing, so I have solid dam more than comfortable with [HTML](#), [CSS](#) and [JS](#). I designed and developed custom websites in Wordpress, Shopify, Joomla. In fact, I created this very website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) an extremely fast open-source static site generator.

I'm deeply interested in open-source projects, and I enjoy exploring these communities. I believe there is great value in the concept of open collaboration, sharing and transparency in order to create truly great products.
